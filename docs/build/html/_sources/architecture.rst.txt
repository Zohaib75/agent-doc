Architecture
============

Muhsie is a self-sovereign digital identity platform—anchored on the Hyperledger Indy blockchain with Hyperledger Aries Agent. The Muhsie Architecture primarily consists of Aries cloud agents, servers, LDAP and a mobile app.
Muhsie identities are fully owned and controlled by the creator—independent of centralized third-parties for creation, control or validation.

Muhsie provides a simple solution for users to log in to your app and share private credentials, such as identity information, contact details and credentials.
You can also ask a user for verified data about themselves.

The Architecture of Muhsie is quite simple because it is an independent cloud agent that can easily be
integrated into any existing system with just few additional API endpoints to be registered.
